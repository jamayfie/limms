## DescriptionThe R package limms provides functions for both unsupervised and supervisedanalyses of mass spectrometry data. More specifically, it provides functions forexploratory data analysis, quality control, preprocessing, and normalizationof mass spectrometry data. It also facilitates contrast-based analyses to identifycompounds/molecules (e.g., adducts, metabolites) that are differentially abundant under different conditions (e.g., treatment/control, cell type). Study designs withmultiple conditions benefit from the ability to specify the contrasts of interest, rather than rely on pairwise or one-vs-all comparisons. limms adapts theexcellent limma package for transcriptomics to mass spectrometry. In addition to providing a portal to limma that maintains mass spectrometry peak information, limms provides the functions necessary to coerce mass spectrometry data into a format readable by limma.  Downstream of differential abundance analysis, limms provides a function to match masses to a user-provided list of knowns.In addition to the analysis and use cases provided in the package vignette, limms is introduced, described and used in the manuscript:Mayfield JA, Raman S, Ramnarine AK, Mishra VK, Huang AD, Dudoit S, Buter J, Cheng TY, Young DC, Nair YM, Ouellet IG, Griebel BT, Ma S, Sherman DR, Mallet L, Rhee KY, Minnaard AJ, Branch Moody D.
